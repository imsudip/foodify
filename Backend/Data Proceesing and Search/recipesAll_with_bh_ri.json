If the cheese still doesn't melt completely, add a splash of milk and put the pan back on the heat for a few seconds. Keep stirring till the cheese melts and then take the pan immediately off the heat. Serve immediately."

This helps rotate the potatoes so one layer isn't exposed to air for too long. The browning does not change the taste, only makes them a little 'less pretty'",
      "Once potatoes are fork tender, switch the heat to 'keep warm' and mash them well using a potato masher or hand blender. Using a hand blender is my favourite method because it helps aerate the potatoes and keeps them light and fluffy.\u00a0",
      "Now comes the good part. Add cream and milk to the mashed potatoes. Make sure the potatoes are still hot when you do this or they won't combine well. Mix them well with a spatula. In the beginning, the potatoes may feel like they are too runny but keep mixing and you'll see the liquid start to get absorbed.\u00a0",
      "Finally, add the remaining butter butter. Check and taste for seasoning. At this stage, I also sometimes like to add cream cheese or sour cream but those are completely optional. Light, fluffy, creamy mashed potatoes are ready!"

Start by adding \u00bd cup water and knead it into a firm dough. You may need a few extra teaspoons of water but add as you go. The consistency of the dough should be stiff. Don't over knead it. Its normal to see a few cracks and dimples. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and set aside while you make the filling.",
      "Heat oil in a pan. While the oil is heating, crush the coriander seeds, saunf (fennel seeds) and methi (fenugreek seeds) roughly and add it to the pan. Fry the spices till aromatic but be careful not to burn them. Add ginger, garlic and green chilies and stir fry for a minute or two. Add the remaining spices, mashed boiled potatoes and salt. I like to use a potato masher to just mash everything together and then mix it. Add the curry leaves right at the end, give it one more good mix and then set the mixture aside to cool.",
      "@@T@@Wrapping the samosas:\u00a0",
      "Take a lime sized bowl of dough, roll it between your palms till smooth and dust it with flour. Roll it out into a circle which is less than 1 mm thickness and about 6 inches in diameter. Cut the rolled dough in half. Pick up one half and brush it with a little water along the straight edge of the pastry.",
      "Now take one edge of the straight side, and place it on the other edge of the straight side in such a way that the dough forms into a cone (watch the video for more clarity). Pinch the corner of the cone so that its sealed. Place a tablespoon and a half of the filling in the cone, making sure to fill it only \u00beth of the way. Brush the inside of the unfilled dough with a little water and seal it by pinching the edge together. Repeat till all the dough is used up. Place the samosas on a greased tray making sure they don't touch each either and cover them with a damp cloth.",
      "Heat about 2 inches oil in a pan. To test if the oil is hot enough, add a tiny piece of dough to the oil and if it bubbles and floats slowly to the surface, your oil is ready for frying. Add the samosas to the oil making sure not to overcrowd the pan, and reduce the flame to a simmer. Fry the samosas on a low flame till golden brown on both side. It's important to fry them on a low flame, or the pastry would be raw from the inside and golden brown on the outside. They take 15-20 minutes to fry. Take them out on a plate lined with paper to absorb any extra oil and serve them immediately with ketchup, coriander chutney or tamarind chutney."

      "@@T@@Momo Wrapper",
      "Warm water on a low flame for 1-2 minutes or in a microwave for 45 seconds to 1 minute, or until the water is very warm ((between 110F/43C to 120F/48C).",
      "Add the flour and water to a mixing bowl. Stir using a wooden spoon or your hands to combine. Alternatively, this can be done in a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment on low speed. Continue mixing until all the water is absorbed. If using a stand mixer, remember to scrape down the sides of the bowl until all the flour and water combine.",
      "Remove and place the dough on a counter and knead it for 2 to 3 minutes. You do not need to dust the surface with flour unless the dough is very sticky. The dough is supposed to be slightly tacky, but not sticky.",
      "After a few minutes of kneading, you should get a pretty smooth ball of dough. It need not be a super smooth dough, some dimples on the surface are okay. Place the dough back into the bowl, and cover it with a damp towel to let it rest for 20-60 minutes.",
      "@@T@@Chicken Filling",
      "Combine all the ingredients for the chicken filling in a bowl. If the filling is very loose, you can add some extra cornflour. Cling wrap or cover with a lid and store in the refrigerator until the momo wrappers are ready.",
      "@@T@@Vegetarian Filling",
      "Heat oil in a wok or heavy bottomed pan on a high flame. Add ginger and garlic and saut\u00e9 for 30 seconds or until fragrant. Next add the onion and saut\u00e9 till they become translucent. Add green chilli, cabbage and carrot, reduce flame to medium high and saut\u00e9 for 3 minutes. Add soy sauce and sugar and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from flame and keep aside. Remember to cool down the mix before placing it inside the wrapper.",
      "@@T@@Wrapping and Pleating Momos",
      "Once the dough has rested, take it out of the bowl and knead it a few times. Make a hole in the centre of the dough with your finger. Then use your fingers to stretch out that hole in the centre. Keep stretching out the dough and rotating it until you get a large ring. Keep rolling out the rope until it is about 1 \u00bd inches in diameter.",
      "Now, cut out smaller pieces of dough, each weighing about 6-7 grams. This is about \u00bd tablespoon of dough. Take each piece of dough and roll it into a ball. Using the fleshy part of your palm, flatten each ball of dough into a disc, about \u00bd inch in diameter. Lightly dust each disc with flour. Using a rolling pin, roll out each individual piece into a very thin round wrapper. They need to be thin enough such that they appear to be slightly translucent. Thicker wrappers tend to taste very doughy so be sure to make it as thin as you can.",
      "Now place about a tablespoon of the prepared filling in the centre of the rolled out wrapper. Shape and seal the wrappers as shown in the video. In order to ensure that it is properly sealed, apply a little bit of water along the edges with your fingertip.",
      "@@T@@Steaming Momos",
      "Prep the steamer by adding water in the bottom container. Place the steamer on a flame and bring the water to a boil. Place the shaped momos in a steamer lined with parchment paper. Ensure that they are not sticking to each other. Cover the lid of the steamer and allow to steam for 6 minutes on a medium flame. Once done, remove from the steamer and serve immediately"

Shape them into golf ball sized round balls and then flatten them using your palms to make a vada. Remember to tightly shape them so they do not fall apart while frying. Keep aside.",
      "Use a kadai or a heavy bottomed pan for frying. Pour in about 1.5 inches of oil and allow it to heat up. Add a small piece of the vada mixture to the pan to check if the oil is hot enough. The vada should float to the top; if it sinks that means the oil is not hot enough. If it browns too quickly, it means the oil is too hot. The vada needs to cook on a low flame so the inside gets cooked evenly without the outside browning too much too soon. ",
      "Once the oil is hot, add as many vadas as possible in a single layer. Do not move or turn the vada for 2-3 minutes after adding as they tend to disintegrate. Do not crowd the pan, fry only a few at a time. ",
      "Fry the vadas for 10-12 minutes on a low flame. Use a skimmer to turn them halfway through so they brown evenly on both sides. Remove from pan and place over a kitchen tissue or in a colander to drain the excess oil. Serve hot."

      "Heat oil in a kadhai or deep pan for frying. To roll out the pooris, take one ball, dip it slightly in oil and roll it out into a circle to 1 mm thickness. Don't worry if you don't get the perfect circle - just make sure it's evenly rolled.",
      "Make sure the oil is very hot. To check, take a small pieces of dough and put it in oil. If it sizzles immediately to the top, the oil is ready for frying.",
      "Take the rolled out dough, hold it vertically above the oil near the edge of the kadhai and gently slide it in (don't plop it in or the oil will splash back). The puri should immediately sizzle to the top. Start pressing it with the back of the spoon and as soon as it starts to puff up, flip it over gently. Keep pressing it gently as it puffs up. Once the puri is golden brown from the bottom, take it out. Repeat this till all the puris are fried."

Once these ingredients have combined, add water little by little to make a thick but runny batter. The consistency should be slightly thick so that it can hold the paneer cubes and coat them well.",
      "On a medium flame, heat oil for frying in a kadai. Dip the prepared paneer (marinated and/or sandwiched), one by one, in the batter and drop them into the hot oil. Fry till it is golden brown in colour, about 2 - 4 minutes, turning them halfway to ensure they cook evenly on both sides.",
      "Remove from the kadai and place it into a colander or a paper towel so the excess oil gets absorbed. Sprinkle some chaat masala and serve hot with some mint chutney or ketchup!"

      "Knead the dough again for a minute or two once rested. Divide it into 4 equal parts and roll out one part into a thin rope. Keep the other three parts of dough covered with a wet cloth. With a knife, cut equal portions (the size of a blueberry) from the rope. Take a piece and roll it between your palm till smooth and press it gently to flatten it out slightly. With the help of a rolling pin, roll it into a circle about 1 \u00bd to 2 inches in diameter. Place the rolled puri on a thick plastic sheet covered with a dry cloth. Repeat the above procedure to make puris from all the dough. Alternatively, you can also roll the dough out into a big circle and use a cookie cutter to cut it.",
      "Heat oil in a karahi till it is very hot but not smoking. We'll follow the first in-first out rule; drop one puri in the hot oil so that the side which was touching the plastic sheet is what goes into the oil first. This is very important. Immediately press the puri lightly with a slotted spoon; and once it puffs up, turn it over. Press them lightly so that they are evenly golden brown from all sides, and then take them out. Fry all the puris in this way.",

      "Blend together chopped mango or tamarind, green chillies, mint, coriander, peppercorns and the spices with 2 cups water till smooth. Place a strainer over a big bowl and line the strainer with a mulmul cloth if you have one. Strain it into the bowl, pressing down on the leftover residue to get all the juice out. Once done discard the leftover residue and add another glass of water to the jaljeera. Taste and adjust the seasoning and if needed add some lemon juice. If and how much lemon juice needs to be added will depend on the sourness of the mangoes and tamarind.",

      "To make the dough, place the flour in the center of a wide mouthed bowl or a plate with a high rim. Make a well in the center and add \u00bc cup water. With your fingers, mix the water and flour together; add another \u00bc cup water and mix. Do the same thing again till the dough starts to roughly come together. If the dough is too dry, add a teaspoon of water at a time. Once the dough comes together, start kneading the dough, alternating between your palms and your knuckles. Press it down with your palm, pull it with your fingers and then pull it back. Use your knuckles to press down on the dough, making indentations and repeat till the dough is soft and pliable. This should take 3-4 minutes. I like adding a few drops of water and kneading and i repeat this process 2-3 times.",
      "Once the dough is ready, cover it with a barely damp cloth and rest it for 15-20 minutes.",
      "While you roll the dough, put a tava on the stove and let it pre-heat. To roll the dough, take a small lime sized piece of dough and smoothen it into a ball between your palms. Place it on a rolling board or the kitchen counter and gently press it down to flatten it. Now dust the dough gently with dry atta and start rolling it. Move the rolling pin along the length, pressing gently as you go. If your roti feels sticky at any point, dust it with some dry flour. Keep rotating the roti in a circular motion and rolling till its approx 5-5.5 inches in diameter and is evenly rolled out.",
      "Make sure the tawa or skillet has heated evenly before you start cooking rotis. It should be hot, but not smoking. Place the roti in the center of the tawa. Wait till you see bubbles on the surface. Once the bubbles form, flip the roti. Once you see bubbles on the other side, use a pair of tongs to flip again and transfer the roti to an open flame. In less than 5 seconds, you'll start to see the roti puff up. Flip again to cook the other side, and remove from the heat. If your roti doesn't puff up, don't worry, just cook it till you see brown spots.",
      " While they are still hot, smear the rotis with ghee so that it melts. Stack them one on top of the other. The residual heat, keeps them soft, and prevents them from drying out.",
      "Make sure the tawa or skillet has heated evenly before you start cooking rotis. It should be hot, but not smoking. Place the roti in the center of the tawa. Wait till you see bubbles on the surface. Once the bubbles form, flip the roti. Once the bubble form on this side, take a soft cloth or towel and start pressing down lightly on the roti, rotating it as you go. It will start puffing up as you press. Roti is cooked when you see light brown spots on both sides. Smear it with ghee or butter while it's still hot, and serve immediately."

Pour the paste into an airtight container which has enough space for the batter to rise slightly and leave in a warm, dry place overnight or even up to 2 days depending upon the weather. When ready, you will see small bubbles forming on the surface due to fermentation. This is the levain for the jalebis.",

Add saffron strands and let this simmer on low till the syrup reaches a temperature of 100C/212F. It shouldn't reach the one thread consistency. Keep the syrup warm on very low heat. You can add a few teaspoons of water later if you need to thin out the syrup again.",

This batter should be of dropping consistency, neither runny nor too thick. Fill this batter into a squeezy bottle (like the one shown in the video), screw the top and leave for about 10 minutes.",
      "Heat ghee or oil in a flat bottomed shallow pan till it reaches 176C/350F. If you don't have a thermometer, squeeze out a drop of the batter in to the pan and if it comes up at once, then the ghee is ready to fry the Jalebis. ",
      "Hold the bottle a few inches over the hot ghee and pipe out small concentric circles or spirals straight into the pan. You may make as many Jalebis as would fit into the pan, without touching each other. Once you finish piping, lower the heat to medium and fry the Jalebis, turning once or twice in between, till golden on both sides.",
      "Lift the Jalebis out of the ghee with a slotted spoon or tongs, draining out any excess ghee and put them straight into the warm sugar syrup, pressing them gently into the syrup to soak. Lift them out of the syrup after half a minute and serve immediately."

Bring the tail up and glue it with the samosa glue to the triangle. This should give you a perfect samosa. Repeat to make the remaining samosas.",
      "Place the samosas on a large baking tray and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. At this point you can also individually freeze them, and place the frozen samosas in a ziplock for use later.",
      "Fill a pan or skillet with about 1 \u00bd inches of oil. Heat the oil till a small piece of wrapper floats instantly to the top. Reduce the flame to medium high and add the samosas to the oil. Do not overcrowd. Fry them on each side for 2-3 minutes till they are golden brown. Transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels and then serve immediately."

Toss the meatballs in 2-3 tablespoon of the sauce while still hot and set aside.",
      "To make the onion rings, heat up oil in a deep vessel or kadhai. Season the tempura flour with salt and chili powder and slowly add water to it. Keep mixing till there are no lumps. The batter should be thick in consistency (same as pakoda batter) so that it coats the onion rings.",
      "Once the oil is hot, dip each onion ring in the tempura batter till it's evenly coated and fry on high heat till golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain the oil on tissue paper.",
      "To assemble the burgers, slice each burger bun in half and lightly heat on each side with a little butter. Top the bottom half with 4 meatballs, and add cheese to it. Place this on a hot pan, cover with a lid and heat it up for a minute till the cheese melts. Top this with onion rings, lettuce and more sauce. Serve with some chilled beer."

Combine with a spoon, spatula or just use your hands like I did. The dough should be moist and slightly sticky. Add extra water by the teaspoon if required. While this does not require kneading like most breads, its good to mix for 3-4 minutes till all the ingredients are properly combined. I just transfer the dough to the counter and knead lightly for a couple of minutes.",

      "To make the dough, combine all the ingredients in a large bowl. If using a stand mixer, mix on low speed using a paddle attachment. However, I prefer to combine by hand.",
      "The dough will be wet and sticky, but this hydration makes for a better crumb structure. Knead by hand for 10-12 minutes and you will notice the dough changing structure to become smoother and less sticky.",
      "Brush a bowl with oil, and leave the dough, covered by cling film, to rise till it doubles in size. This may take between 1 to 1 \u00bd hour.",
      "Once the dough has risen, remove it from the bowl and form it into a loaf or any freestanding shape. While shaping, the dough would deflate. Place the loaf shaped dough into a 9 by 5 inch lightly oiled loaf tin. If making a freestanding shape, place it on a lightly oiled baking tray. Brush lightly with water and sprinkle mixed seeds on it.Use mixed seeds such as pumpkin, melon, sesame and flax for sprinkling.",
      "Cover the dough lightly with a moist cloth. Let the dough rise again at room temperature for 60 minutes or until it almost doubles in size.",
      "Bake in a 175 degree celcius pre-heated oven for 40-45 minutes.",
      "Remove the loaf immediately from pan after baking and cool on a wire rack. To check for doneness, tap the bottom of the loaf and it should sound hollow.",
      "Serve once cooled. This is an important step because the dough continues to cook till it cools down completely."
