        "instructions": "Fried Noodles Boil the noodles with salt and a teaspoon of oil till al dente. My rule of thumb is to boil the noodles for 60 seconds less than the package instructions. Immediately drain them in a colander and wash them thoroughly with cold water. Once they are completely drained, spread them out in an even layer on a sheet or parchment paper and leave them out to dry for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, sprinkle the noodles with cornflour and toss them well. Heat oil in a cast iron skillet or frying pan till it starts shimmering (350F/ 180C). You can drop a small piece of noodle in the oil to check if it's hot enough. If there is no movement in the oil when you drop the noodle, it's not hot enough. Keep the heat to medium high, and add a handful of noodles to the oil, spreading them out. Deep fry them for 2-3 minutes till they are a deep golden brown. Do this in batches so that the temperature of the oil does not drop down significantly once you add the noodles. Drain them out on some tissue paper and let them cool completely before using. Keep aside.  American Chop Suey Sauce Heat oil in a wok or kadai and add ginger and garlic. Stir fry for 30 seconds or until fragrant. Add onions, carrots and capsicum and stir fry on high heat for 1-2 minutes or until onions are translucent. Add cabbage, spring onions and bok choy and stir fry again for 1-2 minutes on high heat.

Add green chillies and continue stirring until the sauce thickens and comes to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 3-4 minutes or until desired consistency has been reached. Add lime juice.

You might see some oxidising on the top layer of potatoes. To avoid that, give them a stir once or twice while they cook. This helps rotate the potatoes so one layer isn't exposed to air for too long. The browning does not change the taste, only makes them a little 'less pretty' Once potatoes are fork tender, switch the heat to 'keep warm' and mash them well using a potato masher or hand blender. Using a hand blender is my favourite method because it helps aerate the potatoes and keeps them light and fluffy.\u00a0 Now comes the good part. Add cream and milk to the mashed potatoes. Make sure the potatoes are still hot when you do this or they won't combine well. Mix them well with a spatula. In the beginning, the potatoes may feel like they are too runny but keep mixing and you'll see the liquid start to get absorbed.\u00a0 Finally, add the remaining butter butter. Check and taste for seasoning. At this stage, I also sometimes like to add cream cheese or sour cream but those are completely optional. Light, fluffy, creamy mashed potatoes are ready! ",

It should resemble a runny consistency. Set aside for 20 minutes. Heat a tawa or non-stick pan over medium heat. Drizzle half a teaspoon of oil or ghee, spread it around and wipe off the excess with a paper towel or kitchen cloth. Check the consistency of the batter before pouring. Use a deep ladle and mix the batter well every time before making a dosa. Once the tawa is hot enough, pour the batter starting from the periphery and then moving in. Do not spread the batter, just pour more to fill any gaps. Cook on medium flame for 2-3 minutes. Drizzle oil or ghee on the sides and the gaps. When the dosa is cooked enough, the edges will leave the pan easily and it will start to look golden brown. At this point flip the dosa and cook for another minute. Flip it back, fold and serve hot. Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve with your choice of chutney or sambar. ",

Start by adding \u00bd cup water and knead it into a firm dough. You may need a few extra teaspoons of water but add as you go. The consistency of the dough should be stiff. Don't over knead it. Its normal to see a few cracks and dimples. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and set aside while you make the filling. Heat oil in a pan. While the oil is heating, crush the coriander seeds, saunf (fennel seeds) and methi (fenugreek seeds) roughly and add it to the pan. Fry the spices till aromatic but be careful not to burn them. Add ginger, garlic and green chilies and stir fry for a minute or two. Add the remaining spices, mashed boiled potatoes and salt. I like to use a potato masher to just mash everything together and then mix it. Add the curry leaves right at the end, give it one more good mix and then set the mixture aside to cool. Wrapping the samosas:\u00a0 Take a lime sized bowl of dough, roll it between your palms till smooth and dust it with flour. Roll it out into a circle which is less than 1 mm thickness and about 6 inches in diameter. Cut the rolled dough in half. Pick up one half and brush it with a little water along the straight edge of the pastry. Now take one edge of the straight side, and place it on the other edge of the straight side in such a way that the dough forms into a cone (watch the video for more clarity). Pinch the corner of the cone so that its sealed. Place a tablespoon and a half of the filling in the cone, making sure to fill it only \u00beth of the way. Brush the inside of the unfilled dough with a little water and seal it by pinching the edge together. Repeat till all the dough is used up. Place the samosas on a greased tray making sure they don't touch each either and cover them with a damp cloth. Heat about 2 inches oil in a pan. To test if the oil is hot enough, add a tiny piece of dough to the oil and if it bubbles and floats slowly to the surface, your oil is ready for frying. Add the samosas to the oil making sure not to overcrowd the pan, and reduce the flame to a simmer. Fry the samosas on a low flame till golden brown on both side. It's important to fry them on a low flame, or the pastry would be raw from the inside and golden brown on the outside. They take 15-20 minutes to fry. Take them out on a plate lined with paper to absorb any extra oil and serve them immediately with ketchup, coriander chutney or tamarind chutney. ",

        "instructions": "Momo Wrapper Warm water on a low flame for 1-2 minutes or in a microwave for 45 seconds to 1 minute, or until the water is very warm ((between 110F/43C to 120F/48C). Add the flour and water to a mixing bowl. Stir using a wooden spoon or your hands to combine. Alternatively, this can be done in a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment on low speed. Continue mixing until all the water is absorbed. If using a stand mixer, remember to scrape down the sides of the bowl until all the flour and water combine. Remove and place the dough on a counter and knead it for 2 to 3 minutes. You do not need to dust the surface with flour unless the dough is very sticky. The dough is supposed to be slightly tacky, but not sticky. After a few minutes of kneading, you should get a pretty smooth ball of dough. It need not be a super smooth dough, some dimples on the surface are okay. Place the dough back into the bowl, and cover it with a damp towel to let it rest for 20-60 minutes. Chicken Filling Combine all the ingredients for the chicken filling in a bowl. If the filling is very loose, you can add some extra cornflour. Cling wrap or cover with a lid and store in the refrigerator until the momo wrappers are ready. Vegetarian Filling Heat oil in a wok or heavy bottomed pan on a high flame. Add ginger and garlic and saut\u00e9 for 30 seconds or until fragrant. Next add the onion and saut\u00e9 till they become translucent. Add green chilli, cabbage and carrot, reduce flame to medium high and saut\u00e9 for 3 minutes. Add soy sauce and sugar and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from flame and keep aside. Remember to cool down the mix before placing it inside the wrapper. Wrapping and Pleating Momos Once the dough has rested, take it out of the bowl and knead it a few times. Make a hole in the centre of the dough with your finger. Then use your fingers to stretch out that hole in the centre. Keep stretching out the dough and rotating it until you get a large ring. Keep rolling out the rope until it is about 1 \u00bd inches in diameter. Now, cut out smaller pieces of dough, each weighing about 6-7 grams. This is about \u00bd tablespoon of dough. Take each piece of dough and roll it into a ball. Using the fleshy part of your palm, flatten each ball of dough into a disc, about \u00bd inch in diameter. Lightly dust each disc with flour. Using a rolling pin, roll out each individual piece into a very thin round wrapper. They need to be thin enough such that they appear to be slightly translucent. Thicker wrappers tend to taste very doughy so be sure to make it as thin as you can. Now place about a tablespoon of the prepared filling in the centre of the rolled out wrapper. Shape and seal the wrappers as shown in the video. In order to ensure that it is properly sealed, apply a little bit of water along the edges with your fingertip. Steaming Momos Prep the steamer by adding water in the bottom container. Place the steamer on a flame and bring the water to a boil. Place the shaped momos in a steamer lined with parchment paper. Ensure that they are not sticking to each other. Cover the lid of the steamer and allow to steam for 6 minutes on a medium flame. Once done, remove from the steamer and serve immediately ",

Soak it for 1 hour 30 minutes, and no longer than that. Once soaked, drain all of the water. Remember to drain as much as possible as excess water will lead to a soggy mix. Add all the ingredients mentioned under 'dry masala' in the chutney jar of the mixer. Grind till it becomes a coarse powder. Transfer the masala mix to a bowl and keep aside.  Add half of the soaked and drained chana dal to the same chutney jar. There is no need to clean the jar. Grind till is becomes a coarse mix, do not grind too much as it will become too loose to make vadas. Its okay if you see a few pieces of whole chana dal. Remove the first batch and transfer to the mixing bowl and repeat the same with the remaining half of the chana dal. Once done, transfer to the mixing bowl.  Add mint, curry leaves, onions, green chilli, ginger garlic paste, turmeric powder, salt and the dry masala to the mixing bowl. Use your hands to mix and make sure it is well combined. Shape them into golf ball sized round balls and then flatten them using your palms to make a vada. Remember to tightly shape them so they do not fall apart while frying. Keep aside. Use a kadai or a heavy bottomed pan for frying. Pour in about 1.5 inches of oil and allow it to heat up. Add a small piece of the vada mixture to the pan to check if the oil is hot enough. The vada should float to the top; if it sinks that means the oil is not hot enough. If it browns too quickly, it means the oil is too hot. The vada needs to cook on a low flame so the inside gets cooked evenly without the outside browning too much too soon.  Once the oil is hot, add as many vadas as possible in a single layer. Do not move or turn the vada for 2-3 minutes after adding as they tend to disintegrate. Do not crowd the pan, fry only a few at a time.  Fry the vadas for 10-12 minutes on a low flame. Use a skimmer to turn them halfway through so they brown evenly on both sides. Remove from pan and place over a kitchen tissue or in a colander to drain the excess oil. Serve hot. ",

Bowl 2: For the dosa batter, soak the toor dal and chana dal in a separate bowl and keep aside. Soak for about 8-12 hours. Day 1 - Evening Once the grains have soaked for about 8 hours, drain the excess water from both the bowls and keep aside. Grind the idli rice urad dal mix in Bowl 1 till almost smooth with approx 1 \u00be to 2 cups ice cold water adding additional water if required. The consistency should be such that it can leave a thick coat on the back of a spoon and falls in a ribbon like consistency when poured with a ladle. Divide the batter by half and transfer into two separate bowls. Ensure they are divided into exactly two halves. One bowl is the idli batter and one bowl is the dosa batter. Grind the toor dal and chana dal mix in bowl 2 with a few tablespoons of water into a smooth batter. Add this to one of the bowls and mix well. This is the dosa batter bowl and the other one without the toor dal and chana dal mix is the idli batter. Cover both bowls and set aside to ferment. Leave it in a warm, dry place away from direct sunlight to ferment. Fermentation takes anywhere between 12-24 hours. The time varies depending on the humidity and warmth of a place. Once fermented, the batter should have almost doubled with a slight dome shape and a wrinkle, bubbly layer on top. You should be able to smell sourness in the batter. This smell means it has fermented. If it is too sour, it has fermented too much! To check, you can also put a spoon into the batter - the texture should be frothy with air bubbles. Day 2 - Morning or Afternoon Add \u00be teaspoon salt to the idli batter and mix well. Add 1 teaspoon salt and sugar to the dosa batter and mix well. To make idlis, grease the idli plates with oil and pour batter into each crevice till its almost full. Arrange the plates onto the idli rack and place in a steamer with a cup of water. Steam for 15 minutes. Allow to cool for 2-3 minutes and use a spoon to remove the idlis from the idli plate. Serve hot along with ghee, sambar and chutney! To make dosas, heat a non-stick tawa or a seasoned cast iron dosa tawa over medium heat. Once hot, sprinkle some water (the water should immediately sizzle) and wipe the pan clean. Pour one ladle of dosa batter and spread it by using the back of the ladle, moving it in concentric circles to form a big round dosa.  Drizzle a spoon or two of oil or ghee around the edges and in the center, and let this roast for 1-2 minutes till golden brown. Then flip it over and roast for 30-seconds.

If the dough is too dry and doesn\u2019t come together, add more water a teaspoon at a time. The dough should be stiffer than roti dough, and should not be too pliable.

Cover this with a cloth and set this aside for 5-10 minutes. Once the dough has rested, roll it into a log and divide it into small gooseberry sized balls (slightly smaller than limes). Roll each piece of dough into smooth balls and then press it slightly. Repeat this till all the balls are formed and cover and set them aside. Heat oil in a kadhai or deep pan for frying. To roll out the pooris, take one ball, dip it slightly in oil and roll it out into a circle to 1 mm thickness. Don't worry if you don't get the perfect circle - just make sure it's evenly rolled. Make sure the oil is very hot. To check, take a small pieces of dough and put it in oil. If it sizzles immediately to the top, the oil is ready for frying. Take the rolled out dough, hold it vertically above the oil near the edge of the kadhai and gently slide it in (don't plop it in or the oil will splash back). The puri should immediately sizzle to the top. Start pressing it with the back of the spoon and as soon as it starts to puff up, flip it over gently. Keep pressing it gently as it puffs up.

Ensure that the powder coats the paneer pieces and allow it to sit for 10-15 minutes. To make stuffed paneer pakoras, cut the paneer into triangles (as shown in the video above). Spread some chutney on one slice and place another triangle on top to make a sandwich. Remove any excess from the sides. Repeat with all the paneer and set aside. Make the pakoda batter in another mixing bowl. First add the besan, rice flour, chilli powder, hing, salt, ginger garlic paste, baking soda and mix well. Once these ingredients have combined, add water little by little to make a thick but runny batter. The consistency should be slightly thick so that it can hold the paneer cubes and coat them well. On a medium flame, heat oil for frying in a kadai. Dip the prepared paneer (marinated and/or sandwiched), one by one, in the batter and drop them into the hot oil. Fry till it is golden brown in colour, about 2 - 4 minutes, turning them halfway to ensure they cook evenly on both sides. Remove from the kadai and place it into a colander or a paper towel so the excess oil gets absorbed. Sprinkle some chaat masala and serve hot with some mint chutney or ketchup! ",

The change in colour happens very quickly so pay close attention (no Instagram please!). Remove from the flame and divide between ramekins (about 1 \u00bd tablespoon between each ramekin) making sure that caramel coats the bottom of the ramekins completely. Let this cool for 2-3 minutes until just set. Pour warm custard over the cooled caramel in ramekins. At this point, if the custard has cooled and looks lumpy, quickly place it back on heat to warm it, and keep whisking to get rid of any lumps. Cover the ramekins with aluminium foil. Bring 2 cups of water to boil in a steamer. Once the water starts boiling, reduce the heat and place ramekins in a steamer basket or a rack. Close the steamer and steam on low heat for 15 minutes. Then turn off the flame and let the ramekins sit in the steamer for another 20 minutes.  Bring the ramekins to room temperature, take off the foil and refrigerate for 6-8 hours.

Knead the dough with your hand for 5-6 minutes till the dough is firm and smooth to touch. You might have to adjust the amount of water by a teaspoon or two. Cover the dough with a wet cloth (squeeze it well so that the cloth is wet but does not have extra water dripping from it) and rest it for 20-25 minutes. Knead the dough again for a minute or two once rested. Divide it into 4 equal parts and roll out one part into a thin rope. Keep the other three parts of dough covered with a wet cloth. With a knife, cut equal portions (the size of a blueberry) from the rope. Take a piece and roll it between your palm till smooth and press it gently to flatten it out slightly. With the help of a rolling pin, roll it into a circle about 1 \u00bd to 2 inches in diameter. Place the rolled puri on a thick plastic sheet covered with a dry cloth. Repeat the above procedure to make puris from all the dough. Alternatively, you can also roll the dough out into a big circle and use a cookie cutter to cut it. Heat oil in a karahi till it is very hot but not smoking. We'll follow the first in-first out rule; drop one puri in the hot oil so that the side which was touching the plastic sheet is what goes into the oil first. This is very important. Immediately press the puri lightly with a slotted spoon; and once it puffs up, turn it over. Press them lightly so that they are evenly golden brown from all sides, and then take them out. Fry all the puris in this way. Wait for them to cool completely and then store them in an airtight container. For the Aloo filling Lightly mash the boiled chana and potato with your hand and mix it with all the other ingredients for the filling. Set aside. For the Jaljeera pani Blend together chopped mango or tamarind, green chillies, mint, coriander, peppercorns and the spices with 2 cups water till smooth. Place a strainer over a big bowl and line the strainer with a mulmul cloth if you have one. Strain it into the bowl, pressing down on the leftover residue to get all the juice out. Once done discard the leftover residue and add another glass of water to the jaljeera. Taste and adjust the seasoning and if needed add some lemon juice. If and how much lemon juice needs to be added will depend on the sourness of the mangoes and tamarind. Chill the jaljeera and add some soaked and lightly squeezed boondi to it if you like. Serving To serve, poke a hole in the puri with your thumb, fill it with aloo masala and pour jaljeera into it. Add some tamarind chutney if you like. Pop it in your mouth immediately and enjoy! ",

Brush the top lightly with water, and sprinkle with sesame and onion seeds (kalonji) and chopped garlic. Lightly press so that they stick to the dough. Turn it over, and brush the other side well with water as well - this helps the naan stick to the tawa. Direct Flame Method: Make sure your pan is really hot. Now place the bottom side down on the tawa so that the side with sesame seeds is facing up. Wait for 5 seconds and cover with a lid, which should be big enough to cover the naan. The naan starts forming air pockets. Wait for 45 seconds. Now flip the tawa so that the naan is in direct contact with the flame (watch video to see this in action). Cook the surface of the naan, moving the tava slightly as you go. Once the surface is brown, your naan is ready. Brush immediately with hot butter. Alternatively, you can also use tongs to cook the naan directly on the flame by transferring it once the bottom is cooked. Induction or Electric Cooktop Method: Make sure your pan is really hot.

The water will start to look muddy and milky. Drain the water and repeat this process 3-4 times till the water starts looking pretty clear. This process washes away the starch, reducing stickiness in cooked rice. Regardless of the method you are using, soak the rice in the amount specified above (refer to the method you are using) for 30 minutes. Use the vessel you are planning to cook the rice in for soaking because we won't be draining the rice. For example, if you plan to use your IP, soak the rice in the inner pot with the water amount specified above for the instant pot. Stovetop Method: Add washed rice and required water to a pot and let it soak for 30 minutes. Place the soaked rice and water on the stove and bring it to a boil. As soon as the water starts boiling, reduce the flame to a simmer and cover and cook for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the rice sit for 5 more minutes. Basmati rice cooked on the stovetop is ready to serve. Instant Pot Method: Transfer the washed rice and required water to the inner pot and let it soak for 30 minutes.\u00a0 After 30 minutes, cook the rice by selecting manual pressure for 4 minutes. Once the 4 minutes are up, and the the beeper goes off, let the pressure release naturally for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, release pressure manually. Rice is ready for serving. Traditional Pressure Cooker Method: Add washed rice and required water to the pressure cooker and let it soak for 30 minutes. Add oil and fix the lid on the pressure cooker and place it on the stove. Cook on medium high heat for two whistles. Turn off the gas once you hear two whistles and let the pressure release naturally. Basmati is ready to be served! ",

With your fingers, mix the water and flour together; add another \u00bc cup water and mix. Do the same thing again till the dough starts to roughly come together. If the dough is too dry, add a teaspoon of water at a time. Once the dough comes together, start kneading the dough, alternating between your palms and your knuckles. Press it down with your palm, pull it with your fingers and then pull it back. Use your knuckles to press down on the dough, making indentations and repeat till the dough is soft and pliable. This should take 3-4 minutes. I like adding a few drops of water and kneading and i repeat this process 2-3 times. Once the dough is ready, cover it with a barely damp cloth and rest it for 15-20 minutes. While you roll the dough, put a tava on the stove and let it pre-heat. To roll the dough, take a small lime sized piece of dough and smoothen it into a ball between your palms. Place it on a rolling board or the kitchen counter and gently press it down to flatten it. Now dust the dough gently with dry atta and start rolling it. Move the rolling pin along the length, pressing gently as you go. If your roti feels sticky at any point, dust it with some dry flour. Keep rotating the roti in a circular motion and rolling till its approx 5-5.5 inches in diameter and is evenly rolled out. Make sure the tawa or skillet has heated evenly before you start cooking rotis. It should be hot, but not smoking. Place the roti in the center of the tawa. Wait till you see bubbles on the surface. Once the bubbles form, flip the roti. Once you see bubbles on the other side, use a pair of tongs to flip again and transfer the roti to an open flame. In less than 5 seconds, you'll start to see the roti puff up. Flip again to cook the other side, and remove from the heat. If your roti doesn't puff up, don't worry, just cook it till you see brown spots.  While they are still hot, smear the rotis with ghee so that it melts. Stack them one on top of the other. The residual heat, keeps them soft, and prevents them from drying out. Make sure the tawa or skillet has heated evenly before you start cooking rotis. It should be hot, but not smoking.

        "instructions": "Making Ghee from Cream: Make sure the cream is cold when you start to make ghee. Place the cream in a large bowl and churn it with a hand blender. After a few minutes, you'll see the cream start to separate into butter and liquid. At this stage, keep churning for 2-3 more minutes till all the cream has separated. Place a sieve over another bowl and cover the sieve with a cheesecloth. Drain the butter in the cheesecloth and collect the remaining liquid or buttermilk in the bowl. Buttermilk can be drunk as is, or can be used for baking later. Collect the edges of the cheesecloth and squeeze out any extra liquid from the butter. Now pour half a cup of ice cold liquid over the butter, so as to almost wash the butter. This helps get rid of any sediments. Once again, squeeze any extra liquid from the butter. At this stage, you can either store the butter in the fridge or use it to make ghee. To make ghee, place the butter in a saucepan over the stove and warm it up. Once the butter melts completely, let it simmer. As the butter simmers, it'll start foaming and splutter. Continue cooking the ghee on low heat for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure the milk solids don't burn at the bottom. As it cooks, it'll start to change colour from a bright yellow to slightly greenish and then to a light golden brown. Once the ghee becomes clear, stops foaming and the milk solids at the bottom turn brown, your ghee is ready! Let it cool for a few minutes before straining it on a cheesecloth. Store it in an airtight jar. Making Ghee from Butter: Take cold butter and cut it into cubes to help it melt evenly. Place the butter in a saucepan and heat it. Once it melts, reduce the heat and let it simmer. As it simmers, the butter will start foaming. Use a spoon to skim off the top foam. Repeat this every few minutes. After about 20-25 minutes of cooking, ghee will start to look clear and will become a golden brown, with the milk solids settling at the bottom. It'll also give out a sweet, nutty aroma. At this point your ghee is ready. Let it cool for a few minutes before straining it with a cheesecloth. Store it in an airtight jar. ",

Refrigerate for 2-3 hours. When ready to cook, preheat the oven at 218 C/425 F for at least 15-20 minutes.  In a bowl mix together butter, garlic, orange zest, chopped rosemary, salt and pepper. Remove the chicken from the brine and pat dry with a kitchen towel. Now, use your thumb between the skin and the flesh over the breast and the legs to make space to stuff the butter in. Spread half the butter under the skin and the remaining all over the chicken. Roast Chicken In a 12 inch cast iron skillet, or on a baking sheet, layer the orange slices at the bottom.

Pour the paste into an airtight container which has enough space for the batter to rise slightly and leave in a warm, dry place overnight or even up to 2 days depending upon the weather. When ready, you will see small bubbles forming on the surface due to fermentation. This is the levain for the jalebis. Heat sugar and water together, stirring occasionally till the sugar dissolves. Add 3 tablespoons milk and the lime juice to this and let it boil for a couple of minutes. You will see that the milk curdles and all the impurities in the sugar will get entangled in this scum. Collect this with a slotted spoon and discard to clean the sugar syrup. Add saffron strands and let this simmer on low till the syrup reaches a temperature of 100C/212F. It shouldn't reach the one thread consistency. Keep the syrup warm on very low heat. You can add a few teaspoons of water later if you need to thin out the syrup again. When ready to fry the jalebis, whisk 3 tablespoons of the levain with \u00bc cup of plain flour and \u00bc cup of water till smooth. This batter should be of dropping consistency, neither runny nor too thick. Fill this batter into a squeezy bottle (like the one shown in the video), screw the top and leave for about 10 minutes. Heat ghee or oil in a flat bottomed shallow pan till it reaches 176C/350F. If you don't have a thermometer, squeeze out a drop of the batter in to the pan and if it comes up at once, then the ghee is ready to fry the Jalebis.  Hold the bottle a few inches over the hot ghee and pipe out small concentric circles or spirals straight into the pan. You may make as many Jalebis as would fit into the pan, without touching each other. Once you finish piping, lower the heat to medium and fry the Jalebis, turning once or twice in between, till golden on both sides. Lift the Jalebis out of the ghee with a slotted spoon or tongs, draining out any excess ghee and put them straight into the warm sugar syrup, pressing them gently into the syrup to soak.

Heat oil in a pan and add the onions. On a medium flame, shallow fry the onions for 15 minutes till they are a deep golden brown, without burning them. Drain them out on a paper towel, and set aside. These can be made ahead and stored in an air tight container overnight. Burnt onions will add a bitter flavor to the biryani. You can also use store bought fried onions/ shallots which are easily available in leading supermarkets, Indian and Asian stores. Mix together all the ingredients under chicken marinade and marinate for at least two hours or overnight for best results. When you are ready to make the biryani, soak saffron strands in hot milk and rub them slightly with the back of a spoon. Set this aside. Bring water to a roaring boil and add salt, whole spices and basmati rice. Cook for exactly 5 minutes and drain completely, leaving the whole spices in the rice. This will cook the rice to about 70% doneness which can be checked by pressing a grain of rice between two fingers - the rice should still be raw in the middle. Layering and Cooking Chicken Biryani:\u00a0Heat a heavy bottomed pot like a\u00a0dutch oven, and add the chicken to it. Cook for 4 minutes and then turn the chicken pieces once. Cover and cook for another 3 minutes. Turn off the heat. Scatter half the onions all over the chicken, and then sprinkle all the coriander and mint leaves. Next layer the rice all over the mint and coriander, and in the end drizzle saffron milk and ghee all over the rice. Cover and cook on a low flame for 20 minutes - this will help steam the rice, cook it to doneness and cook the chicken. (Note 4) Once the biryani is cooked, let it rest for 5-10 minutes, and finish by scattering the remaining onions on top. Serve hot digging the spoon deep to get all the layers. ",

This will act as glue when we start wrapping the samosas. Wrapping Samosas (Also see step by step pictures above) To start wrapping the samosas, make sure the samosa sheets are completely thawed, and keep them covered with a damp cloth so that they don't dry out. Start by bringing the bottom right corner of the sheet, halfway up to the left side. From the top, you should be able to see a triangle forming underneath. Add some of the flour paste to stick the fold that has formed to the rest of the sheet. Add a little more paste to the left hand side of the sheet. Now bring the triangle that has formed on the left side, down to the right side, landing on the paste you just added. A cone shape should now be formed. Make sure that each corner of the cone is tight, and there is no hole there or the filling will escape while frying. You can use the samosa glue to seal it together. Lift the samosa sheet and hold the cone in your hand by forming a circle between your fore finger and thumb. Stuff the cone with about 1\u00bd tablespoons of the cheese mixture. Place the filled cone/sheet back on your working surface, and lightly flatten the filling. Seal the edge with some samosa glue so that the filling doesn't escape. Brush the samosa glue on all the remaining sides as well. Fold down the filled cone to the left side, then fold once again to the right side. You should now have a perfect triangle with a little wrapper sticking out. Bring the tail up and glue it with the samosa glue to the triangle. This should give you a perfect samosa. Repeat to make the remaining samosas. Place the samosas on a large baking tray and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. At this point you can also individually freeze them, and place the frozen samosas in a ziplock for use later. Fill a pan or skillet with about 1 \u00bd inches of oil. Heat the oil till a small piece of wrapper floats instantly to the top. Reduce the flame to medium high and add the samosas to the oil. Do not overcrowd. Fry them on each side for 2-3 minutes till they are golden brown. Transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels and then serve immediately. ",

You may need to microwave it for another 30 seconds, so make sure you are using a microwave safe bowl. Once the chocolate is smooth, whisk in the lavender extract. Cover the bowl with cling film and refrigerate for at least 4-5 hours. 30 minutes before you are ready to roll out your truffles, place a baking tray covered with foil in the fridge to cool, along with two spoons and a fork. Fill a ziplock bag with ice and wrap it in a kitchen towel. You will need this to keep your hands cold. Use a spoon to scoop out roughly two teaspoons truffle mixture and place on the foil lined sheet, till you\u2019ve used up all the mixture. You should get 10-12 parts. Now place your hands on the wrapped ziplock bag for a few seconds to cool them and start rolling out the truffle mixture. I needed to cool my hands after every two truffle balls but it depends on how cold your kitchen is. Place the rolled truffles in freezer for 20 minutes. Once 20 minutes are up, remove the truffles and leave them on the counter for 5 minutes.

Whisk the chocolate till it's smooth and let it sit on the counter for 3-4 minutes till it comes to room temperature. Don\u2019t be tempted to place the bowl in the fridge to speed up the cooling process because the chocolate will start solidifying. Now use a fork to dip each truffle ball into the melted white chocolate, and a spoon to slide them back on the baking tray. Repeat till all the truffles are covered. Pour the remaining white chocolate into a piping bag and pipe your favorite pattern on the truffles. Sprinkle with dried lavender. This is just for extra prettiness and completely optional.

        "instructions": "Start by making the dough. Mix honey and yeast in lukewarm water and set aside for five minutes till the yeast becomes frothy. You can skip this step if you are using instant yeast, but I still like to do this. Mix together both the flours and salt in a large bowl. Add the frothy yeast mixture and mix till the dough comes together. Make a slight dent in the dough and add olive oil. Start kneading the dough and transfer it to the kitchen platform. If kneading by hand, knead for 10-12 minutes. The dough will start off being sticky, and you can add a little extra flour if you like but I prefer not to. As you knead, the dough will start becoming smooth and supple. Once the dough is sufficiently kneaded, brush the bowl with a little oil and place the dough in it. Cover and keep in a warm, draft free area for an hour or so till the dough doubles in size. Pre-heat oven to 220 degrees celsius or 250 degrees if your oven permits it. Place the baking sheet in the oven to heat while you roll out the pizza. Add the smashed garlic cloves to butter and gently heat till the garlic starts browning slightly. Set aside. Lightly punch out the dough, and divide it into two parts. Form each portion into a ball and with your hands start stretch the dough into a 10 inch circle with slightly thick edges. If you can't do this, feel free to use a rolling pin to roll the dough out. Spread \u00be cup keema on each base. Using oven mitts, take the baking sheet out of the oven, and carefully transfer pizza on the baking sheet. Brush the edges and the top with garlic butter and place the pizza in the oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes till the bottom is lightly brown and cooked through. This timing works when the oven is heated to 220 degree celsius. Timings will vary slightly if your oven allows higher temperature. 5 minutes before your pizza is ready (at the 15 minute mark), take it out and top with Mozzarella and chili flakes. Place it back in the oven till the cheese melts. Serve hot, topped with coriander leaves. ",

You should get 13-15 balls. Heat the paniyaram or appe pan and brush it with oil. Place kofta balls in the pan and cook them on all sides till golden brown. This should take 2-3 minutes on each side. For the curry, start by adding onions, bayleaf, green chilies, ginger, garlic and cashews along with a cup and a half of water to a pot. Bring to a boil and then simmer for ten minutes till the onions are cooked. Once cool, strain the water but don't throw it away. Remove the bayleaf and grind the mixture to a paste with a tablespoon or so of reserved water. In another pot, bring water to a boil and add the spinach. Immediately switch off the flame, and cover the pot. Let this sit for 2 minutes. In the meanwhile, prepare a pot with water and ice cubes in it. Strain the spinach leaves and dump them in the ice water. The leaves will immediately get a bright green color. Let them sit for half a minute, strain, and grind the spinach to a fine paste. In a pan, heat oil and add cinnamon, cloves and cardamom. Add the onion paste and cook for 3-4 minutes. Please note that we don't want to brown the paste. Add tomatoes and cook till the tomatoes almost start breaking down. Stir in garam masala, salt, spinach paste and some of the reserved water. Bring this to a boil and then let it simmer for 5 minutes. You can add more water depending on how thick or thin you like your gravy. Add the kofta balls right towards the end and switch off the flame. Boiling the koftas may result in them breaking down. To temper the curry, heat ghee or butter in a small pan and add cumin seeds.

Add the butter pieces and pulse just till the mixture resembles large bread crumbs. You should see pea-sized pieces of butter along with the bread crumb like mixture. Add water and pulse another 2-3 times. Transfer this to a work surface, and knead together for 20 seconds till the mixture forms into a craggly dough. Flatten into a disk, wrap in clingfilm and chill in the refrigerator for 30-45 minutes. For the filling: While the dough is chilling, dump all the ingredients under filling in a pan. Bring to a boil and then simmer on low heat for 25-30 minutes. Once the apples are soft, set the mixture aside to cool. Once cooled, remove one cinnamon stick and all the cloves. Blend the rest (including the other cinnamon stick) till smooth. Assembling the Chips: Pre-heat your oven to 200 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. To assemble, remove pie dough from the refrigerator. Leave it on the counter for 5 minutes. Divide the pie dough equally into two parts. Sprinkle your work surface lightly with flour, and roll out one half of the dough into half a centimeter thick rectangle shape. I forgot to measure mine, but you can loosely shape it into a rectangle. Spread the filling on this dough while leaving a half inch border on all four sides and set aside. Quickly roll out the other dough in roughly the same shape. Gently lift it up and place it on the other dough. Don't worry if your edges don't meet exactly. Pinch the edges together as well as you can. Place this on the lined baking sheet, and use a pizza cutter or knife to cut the dough into half inch long 'chips'. This should yield 12-14 long chips which can either be cut into half or kept as is. Brush with egg wash (whisk together an egg and two tablespoons water) and sprinkle with sugar.

Just layer them at the bottom of the pan and layer the chicken on top. Resist the temptation to stir things around too much. Place a lid and cook for 20-25 minutes. Half way through, turn the chicken once. When the chicken is just about cooked (around the 20 min mark), take off the lid, let all the water evaporate and let it brown in its juices.

This is called Whey. Bring up the sides of the cloth, and tie tightly with a string to form a sort of a bag. Tie the string around a wooden spoon and place it in a deep bowl in such a way that the spoon is resting across the bowl and the bottom of the bag does not touch the bowl. This leaves space for the whey to drip into the bowl. Place this apparatus in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Keep checking every few hours to remove any whey that may have collected. The idea is to ensure that the bag does not get submerged in the whey. Do not discard the whey, which is quite useful. For starters, it can be used instead of water to knead dough. Once 24 hours are up, remove the bag and untie it. The yogurt should have thickened up considerably and should start to look like cream cheese. Transfer this to a bowl and add salt. Mix well. Take the same cloth and line a bowl with it. Transfer cream cheese to the lined bowl, and wrap with cloth on top to cover the cheese. Place a heavy weight on top of this. You could use a heavy plate, or another bowl filled with water. Leave this in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. After 2 days remove, unwrap and Voila, your cream cheese is ready! Makes 2 Cups. ",

Grease an 8X5 inch loaf tin with butter and line with parchment paper in such a way that the parchment paper hangs over the edges. This will help you lift out the banana bread easily once its baked. You can pop some almonds or walnuts, whatever it is you are using, in the oven for 10 minutes while its pre-heating to roast them. Once roasted, chop them up and keep aside. Once the butter has cooled, add sugar and mix. Add eggs one at a time, mixing after each egg till everything has combined. Add the milk and vanilla extract to this mixture, and give it another whisk. Peel the bananas and mash them into the mixture. I like my bread chunky but you can mash the bananas completely if you like. In another bowl, combine the flours, baking soda and salt. Sift this into the bowl with the banana mixture, and fold till everything is combined. There is no need to blend or over mix. Add the nuts and mix. Sprinkle with a little sugar (This gives an amazing crunchy crust to the bread). Tap once to get rid of air bubbles, and place pan in the oven. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes. Start checking for done-ness around 50 minutes. A skewer or fork inserted into the middle should come out clean. Once done, let the bread cool in the pan for 8-10 minutes.

However, I prefer to combine by hand. The dough will be wet and sticky, but this hydration makes for a better crumb structure. Knead by hand for 10-12 minutes and you will notice the dough changing structure to become smoother and less sticky. Brush a bowl with oil, and leave the dough, covered by cling film, to rise till it doubles in size. This may take between 1 to 1 \u00bd hour. Once the dough has risen, remove it from the bowl and form it into a loaf or any freestanding shape. While shaping, the dough would deflate. Place the loaf shaped dough into a 9 by 5 inch lightly oiled loaf tin. If making a freestanding shape, place it on a lightly oiled baking tray. Brush lightly with water and sprinkle mixed seeds on it.Use mixed seeds such as pumpkin, melon, sesame and flax for sprinkling. Cover the dough lightly with a moist cloth.

Sear the chicken on both sides for about 3 minutes each. Cover the pan, and let the chicken cook for about 8-10 minutes till cooked. A fork should easily insert into the thickest part of the thigh.

Beat together on high speed for 5-6 minutes or until sugar is partly dissolved and the mix is pale and fluffy. It should be of ribbon consistency. To this add vanilla extract and milk and stir to combine. Mixing Bowl 2: Sieve the dry ingredients together (flour, baking powder and salt). Pour the egg yolk mix on top of the flour mix and gently fold to combine. Set this cake batter aside.  Mixing Bowl 3: Whip egg whites for about 30 seconds to a minute or till they are foamy. Continue whipping and add the remaining \u00bcth cup of sugar little by little. Keep whipping until soft peaks are achieved, for about 3-4 minutes. Add all of the egg white mix to the cake batter. Gently fold till it is well combined. Be sure to be gentle with it as you don't want to knock out any air.  Pour the prepared batter into the baking dish. Bake in the oven at 170C for 40-45 minutes or until the cake is firm to touch. When done, poke a toothpick or skewer into the centre of the cake, it should come out clean. Allow the cake to cool down for 30 minutes.  Eggnog Whisk sugar and egg yolk using a hand blender or a whisk. Whisk till pale and creamy, about 2-3 minutes. Heat milk, vanilla extract and nutmeg in a saucepan and bring it to a gentle simmer. Now slowly whisk the milk into the egg mixture, making sure to add the milk mixture in a thin, steady stream so that you don't scramble the eggs. Keep whisking continuously till all the milk is whisked in. Transfer the mixture back to the saucepan and cook on medium heat till the eggnog slightly thickens. Keep stirring as it heats to keep it from sticking to the bottom. Once the eggnog is ready, add the whisky, mix and transfer it to a jug. Keep aside. Whipped Cream Using a beater or stand mixer with whisk attachment, beat the whipping cream for 3-5 minutes or until soft peaks are achieved. Add the sugar little by little and continue to whisk for another minute. Set aside or refrigerate if using later.  Assembly Once the cake is almost at room temperature, use a toothpick or a fork to poke holes all over the surface of the cake. This is to ensure that the eggnog soaks up the sponge evenly. While the eggnog is still warm, pour it over the sponge and allow it to soak up. Once done, leave it aside so the sponge can absorb all of the syrup. Poke more holes if necessary. Refrigerate it for 30-40 minutes. Remove from the refrigerator and add the whipped cream on top of the sponge. Use a palette knife or the back of the spoon to evenly spread it out. Dust some cinnamon powder using a fine sieve. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or if you can\u2019t wait, dig in already! The dish just tastes better when chilled.

        "instructions": "Rub ginger garlic paste and lemon juice over chicken and set aside to marinate for 15 minutes. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a non stick pot and add the chicken pieces. Brown them on high flame for 2-3 minutes on either side. Remove from pan and set aside. Add \u00bd tablespoon oil to the same pan. Add the bayleaf, cinnamon, ginger, garlic and sliced onions. Its important to use the same pan because the browned bits of chicken stuck to the pan help make the wonderful sauce. Saute the onions for 10-15 minutes till golden brown. Add mushrooms and saute for 2-3 minutes. Add the carrots, radish and the chicken. Stir for a few minutes. Add the chicken stock, black pepper and salt. Cover and cook for 20-25 minutes. Taste to check for seasoning. Add the flour to water and mix till there are no lumps to make a slurry. Add the slurry to the pot and bring to a boil while stirring continuously. Simmer for 5-10 minutes. Let the stew sit for a few minutes before serving. It tastes even better if its been sitting for a few hours or overnight. Serve warm with bread or rice. ",
